java-common
===========

Some commons codes that I use when developing Java.

Below are the capabilities that are included in this package:
* ObjectFactory - Provides a generic factory to allocate objects as needed while enabling object reuse.
* ReusableObjectList - A list-like object that, when cleared, doesn't remove objects instead leaves them available to be reused later.  
* hash.MurmurHash2 - Murmur hash 2 methods
* hash.MurmurHash3 - Murmur hash 3 methods
